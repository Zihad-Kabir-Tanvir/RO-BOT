# Overview

RO-BOT is a multi-purpose discord bot. You can use it as a admin bot or use this as a python compiler in discord(but that feature is available only for owners. so, if you want to use it you have to self-host it). You can manage this bot from discord also. Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=767393624454332459&scope=bot) to invite it in your server
